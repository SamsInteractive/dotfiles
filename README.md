# Arch Linux + Hyprland Dotfiles

A collection of my own personal dotfiles/scripts for Arch Linux + Hyprland.</br>
They are far from complete and are a slow but consistent work in progress.

I do not currently recommend anyone use the contents of this repo on their own machine, as they currently contain device specific configurations, most of which will likely not work for others.

These will be updated in the future to be more easily used on installs of most major distros (with streamline Hyprland setups), though I do not know when that future will be.
